Some tools needed by myself in study. Descriptions will be given in the script.
1. EarthdataDownload.py
This is used to bulk download data from earthdata.nasa.gov. Input required is the link list.
2. mosaic.py
This is used to do mosaic for geotiff data. Put the pre-processing image at the same folder and run.

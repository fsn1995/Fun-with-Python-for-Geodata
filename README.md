Some tools needed by myself in study. Descriptions will be given in the script.
1. EarthdataDownload.py
This is used to bulk download data from earthdata.nasa.gov. Input required is the link list.
2. mosaic.py
This is used to do mosaic and subset by roi for geotiff data. The process is done with rasterio library.

# PythonFSN
Some tools needed by myself in study. Descriptions will be given in the script.
1. [EarthdataDownload.py](https://github.com/fsn1995/Fun-with-Python-for-Geodata/blob/master/EarthdataDownload.py)
This is used to bulk download data from earthdata.nasa.gov. Input required is the link list.
2. [mosaic.py](https://github.com/fsn1995/Fun-with-Python-for-Geodata/blob/master/mosaic.py)
This is used to do mosaic and subset by roi for geotiff data. The process is done with rasterio library.
